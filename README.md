# List the things you added for points
(1) I created 26 knots in total which is a story of spending time on a beach exploring, playing, and enjoying.
(2) I have one loop in the creature_encounter knot. I added a logic that the related options will only show up if the loop has shown the corresponding text. Once players have seen the text, the corresponding options will show forever.
(3) Players can pick up things like coconuts and eat them, as well as pick up an amulet and wear it. Notice that every time players gather coconuts, they get three. By eating the coconuts, players can gain more strength.
(4) Players have strength which limits their actions in some of the situations. For example, players can not open the treasure chest if their strength is less than 2.
(5) I added some booleans to track if one knot has been shown. If so then the text will change the next time.
